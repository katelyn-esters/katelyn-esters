- 👋 Hi, I’m @katelyn-esters
- 👀 I’m interested in helping to bridge the gap between those "in the know" and those not "in the know." Essentially, I am concentrating in translating data from pieces of information to actual stories that real people can understand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R! Bring it on, tidyverse, bring it on. Note: tibbles are *different* from tribbles.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects considering the inclusivity and accessibility of their final data analysis/visualizations and conclusions.
- 📫 How to reach me: hmu at katelyn.esters@gmail.com!
